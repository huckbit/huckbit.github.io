Hi, I'm Max and I'm a *web developer*.  I'm working in this area with a lot of passion and dedication for many years. In my job I always enjoy css animations… I’m a big fan of css language! I’m also very keen to learn something new in web development.

You can find some of my project on my [github](https://github.com/huckbit) page, or some of my front-end _"pen"_ inside my [codepen](http://codepen.io/huckbit/) page.

I'm also very passionate about photography. Follow my latest shots on [www.massimilianoranauro.com](http://www.massimilianoranauro.com).
