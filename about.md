Hi, I'm Max and I'm a *web developer* and *web designer*. I'm working with this lovely kind of stuff for many years. I really enjoy css3 animations, and transitions most of the time in my job. Also I always have fun learning something new.

I wish to join my girlfriend on the Isle of Wight quite soon (this is a lovely and pacefull place) ... so if you are looking for a passionate web developer and you are in the South of UK please contact me.

You can find some of my code at:
