Finally I got from Amazon this fast wifi dongle that’s working also with Ubuntu 18.04. The TP-link AC1200(T4UH) doesn’t come up with plug and play functionality but the driver is very easy to install on Ubuntu and Debian distributions.
The dongle is based on the [RealteK RTL8812AU](https://www.realtek.com/zh-tw/products/productsView.aspx?Langid=1&PFid=57&Level=5&Conn=4&ProdID=397) chipset, and luckly this driver it’s already present on the official repository. All you need to do it’s launch this command from you terminal to install it:

```bash
sudo apt install rtl8812au-dkms
```

plug in your device and it should be ready to connect to the WIFI!
