# less command.

The keys in `less` are similar to `Vim`:

#### Forward Search
```bash
/ – search for a pattern which will take you to the next occurrence.
n – for next match in forward
N – for previous match in backward
```

#### Backward Search
```bash
? – search for a pattern which will take you to the previous occurrence.
n – for next match in backward direction
N – for previous match in forward direction
```


#### To navigate in large files
```bash
CTRL+F – forward one window
CTRL+B – backward one window
CTRL+D – forward half window
CTRL+U – backward half window
j – navigate forward by one line
k – navigate backward by one line
G – go to the end of file
g – go to the start of file
q or ZZ – exit the less pager
```


#### Other useful options
```bash
v – using the configured editor edit the current file.
h – summary of less commands
&pattern – display only the matching lines, not all.
```

#### File paging
You can open multiple files passing the file names as arguments:
```bash
$ less file1 file2
```
