If you are using OSX this is wonderful because you can customise your command line by adding emoji icons to the bash prompt.

You can find icons inside your Edit menu: `Edit -> Emoji & Symbols`.

How to add custom icons to our bash?

So edit your `.bash_profile` with your favorite editor vim or nano for example, and add this line:

```
PS1=" "
```

Open **Emoji & Symbol** panel and drag and drop your favorite emoji inside quotation marks.

Depending on terminal settings, nothing may be visible after using drag & drop. Close and reopen you terminal and voilÃ :

You can customise terminal bash with some others options:

| code   | description                             
|:-------|:----------------------------------------|
| \d     | Current date                             
| \t     | Current time                             
| \h     | Host name                                
| \#     | Command number                           
| \u     | User name                                
| \W     | Current working directory (ie: Desktop/)
| \w     | Current working directory with full path


This is my favourite customisation:

```
PS1="ðŸŒ€  \u@\h\W$ "
```

Whatâ€™s yours?
