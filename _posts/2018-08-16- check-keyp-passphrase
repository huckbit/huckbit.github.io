How can we check the passphrase of a private key?

Use following command:

```bash
ssk-keygen -y 
```

- If the input is the correct passphrase, the system will show you the related public key.
- for the wrong passphrase, you'll receive load failed.
- If the key has no passphrase, the system won't ask you for a passphrase and will immediately show you the associated public key.
